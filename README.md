# RakshakCI : Infrastructure Automation for Microsoft Azure  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**RakshakCI** is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** framework engineered to automate the entire lifecycle of cloud resources on **Microsoft Azure**.  

It transcends basic provisioning by embedding **security, compliance, and operational excellence** into its core design principles. Built on **Terraform**, it provides a structured, modular, and highly reusable methodology for defining and deploying complex cloud environments, from development to production.

## ⚙️ Implementation via Azure DevOps Classic Pipeline  
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of RakshakCI's principles using an **Azure DevOps Classic Pipeline**, showcasing a robust CI/CD workflow for infrastructure deployment.  

### 🔑 Key Pipeline Highlights  
- **Classic Pipeline Creation** – Designed and configured in Azure DevOps to orchestrate the Terraform lifecycle.  
- **Modular Deployment** – Works seamlessly with RakshakCI's modular structure, deploying reusable components for **network, compute, storage, and database** layers.  
- **Secure Authentication** – Configured **Azure Service Connections (Service Principals)** for secure, authenticated communication with Azure.  
- **Integrated Terraform Workflow** – Executes `init`, `validate`, `plan`, and `apply` in a staged and controlled manner.  
- **Secret Management** – Integrated **Azure Key Vault** for securely retrieving secrets at runtime.  
- **Governance Integration** – Enforces compliance with **Azure Policy** and secures deployments via **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

## 🏗 Classic Pipeline Stages  
The pipeline follows a logical, gated process to ensure **safety and reliability**:  

1. **Checkout Code** – Fetches Terraform modules and configurations from GitHub.  
2. **Initialize Terraform** – Runs `terraform init`, configuring **Azure Storage Account backend** for secure state management.  
3. **Validate & Plan** – Runs `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` to preview infrastructure changes.  
4. **Approval Gate (Optional)** – Manual approval for production before applying changes.  
5. **Apply Changes** – Runs `terraform apply` to provision/update infrastructure.  
6. **Post-Deployment Scans** – Triggers **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and security scans for compliance.

## 🧩 Core Architectural Principles  

### 🔹 Modularity & Reusability  
- **Self-Contained** – Each module manages its own dependencies, variables, and outputs.  
- **Configurable** – Customizable via input variables without altering core code.  
- **Composable** – Modules can be nested within higher-level environment configs.  

### 🔹 Environment Abstraction  
- **Module Layer** – The reusable building blocks (the “how”).  
- **Configuration Layer** – Environment-specific `.tfvars` to inject parameters (VM sizes, SKUs, IP ranges, etc.).  

### 🔹 State Management & Isolation  
- Uses **Azure Storage Accounts with state locking** for secure and collaborative Terraform state management.  
- State is isolated per environment/component to minimize blast radius.

## 🔒 Holistic Security & Compliance Enforcement  

- **Secrets Management** – Sensitive data never stored in variables or state files; always retrieved from **Azure Key Vault**.  
- **Policy-as-Code (PaC)** – Enforces compliance with **Azure Policy** (e.g., storage must block public access).  
- **Pre-Deployment Scanning** – Tools like **Terrascan** and **Checkov** scan IaC against CIS/NSA benchmarks.  
- **Post-Deployment Scanning** – Continuous assessment with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

## 🚀 Operational Benefits & Value Proposition  

- **Velocity & Consistency** – Cuts environment provisioning from weeks → minutes. Eliminates manual drift.  
- **Reliability & Risk Reduction** – Version-controlled, automated deployments are predictable & peer-reviewed.  
- **Cost Optimization** – Environments can be torn down when not in use. Modules default to cost-effective options.  
- **Enhanced Security Posture** – Secure-by-default configurations and continuous compliance scanning.  
- **Knowledge Sharing** – IaC serves as executable documentation, easing onboarding and collaboration.
